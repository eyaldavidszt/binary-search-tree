A go at binary search trees. I've learned a lot, not just about recursion but more importantly about how much I needed to improve my code organization, design, and readability! I realized this partway through, but figured I will go with the current design and think about these things in future projects...

Anyhow, this binary search tree includes some cool methods. You can insert and delete a node, find a specific node, traverse the tree in level, pre, and postorder, find a specific node's height or depth, check if the tree is balanced and also rebalance an existing tree.

This was fun, T.O.P baby ðŸ˜Ž
